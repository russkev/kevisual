        <p class="partial">Jinx is a web app designed to make it easy for anyone to create their own ePortfolio web
          page.
          It started as
          part of a group project with 4 other people at university. I have since refactored a large portion of the site
          and
          added a lot of features myself.</p>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>We initially met with our client (a student from another subject) to discuss possible designs. From these
          discussions,
          we determined that the app must:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Be easy to use</li>
          <li>Allow an arbitrary number of users to create portfolios</li>
          <li>Allow users to customise the arrangement of content</li>
          <li>Facilitate sharing of portfolios</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our team employed scrum processes in order to get the job done in the time available. We had 3 week sprints
          and
          a
          standup every week (university time commitments meant we couldn’t have one every day). We used Trello to keep
          track of
          our product backlog.</p>
        <p>Once the semester was over I decided to make my own fork of the project so that I could clean up some of the
          code
          and
          implement some features that we didn’t have for.</p>

            <li>Edit page interactivity, including the ability to add sections, change section type and re-order

          <h2>Testing</h2>
          <h3>User Acceptance Testing</h3>
          <p>We used a Google survey to conduct user acceptance testing in the final sprint. We made sure to use a good
            mix of male
            and female volunteers as well as a range of devices and browsers. This process was invaluable and revealed a
            large
            number of usability problems which we had not foreseen when using the application ourselves.</p>
          <h3>Integration Testing</h3>
          <p>We made use of native Django tests to conduct integration testing. For each API endpoint, we made a test
            database
            and
            simulated HTTP requests before checking that the responses were what was expected.</p>

        <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Allow users to
            download the necessary files and host them on a site like Netlify once they are happy with their portfolio</li>
          <li>Allow fine grained control of the final look of the portfolio page</li>
          <li>On desktop screens that are big enough, show the edit page and the final portfolio on the same page</li>
          <li>Implement better SEO and accessibility features</li>
        </ul>
