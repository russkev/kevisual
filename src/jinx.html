      <p class="partial">Jinx is a web app designed to make it easy for anyone to create their own ePortfolio web page.
        It started as
        part of a group project with 4 other people at university. I have since refactored a large portion of the site
        and
        added a lot of features myself.</p>

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>We initially met with our client (a student from another subject) to discuss possible designs. From these
        discussions,
        we determined that the app must:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Be easy to use</li>
        <li>Allow an arbitrary number of users to create portfolios</li>
        <li>Allow users to customise the arrangement of content</li>
        <li>Facilitate sharing of portfolios</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our team employed scrum processes in order to get the job done in the time available. We had 3 week sprints and
        a
        standup every week (university time commitments meant we couldn’t have one every day). We used Trello to keep
        track of
        our product backlog.</p>
      <p>Once the semester was over I decided to make my own fork of the project so that I could clean up some of the
        code
        and
        implement some features that we didn’t have time to get to. I ended up completely refactoring large portions of
        both the
        backend and the frontend but was finally able to get it to a place I was happy with.</p>

        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <h3>User Acceptance Testing</h3>
        <p>We used a Google survey to conduct user acceptance testing in the final sprint. We made sure to use a good
          mix of male
          and female volunteers as well as a range of devices and browsers. This process was invaluable and revealed a
          large
          number of usability problems which we had not foreseen when using the application ourselves.</p>
        <h3>Integration Testing</h3>
        <p>We made use of native Django tests to conduct integration testing. For each API endpoint, we made a test
          database
          and
          simulated HTTP requests before checking that the responses were what was expected.</p>
